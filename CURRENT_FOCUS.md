## One active epic

# Repository safety and rights (WS-1)

## Last authorized task — completed

# `TASK-0001` — Preserve and trace the D40 dataset provenance

**Status: `COMPLETED`**

Authorized 2026-08-06 (`docs/program/PLAN_REGISTRY.yaml`, `bootstrap_status.first_task`).
Executed and merged as commit `0ac5b2a`.

```text
Specification   docs/tasks/TASK-0001.md
Findings        docs/program/OD-2-PROVENANCE-FINDINGS.md
Raw evidence    research/dictionaries/D40-0001/
```

It was executed under the bounded scope defined in TASK-0001 and produced exactly
the four files authorized by §4.

**Completion did not resolve OD-2.** Per TASK-0001 §15, completing it did not grant
permission to use, publish, remove, or redistribute the dataset. Its status remains
`RIGHTS_AND_PROVENANCE_UNRESOLVED` until the owner resolves OD-2 on the evidence the
task produced.

## Currently active

**No implementation task is currently authorized and in progress.**

This means no formally recorded implementation task is active. It does not mean the
project is inactive: governance, documentation, and infrastructure work has merged
since TASK-0001 under direct owner instruction rather than under a recorded successor
implementation task. No successor implementation task has been selected or authorized.

## Do not start

```text
Git-history remediation                 OD-1 — separate decision, six prerequisites
Any D40 compilation, audit, or search   OD-2 — status RIGHTS_AND_PROVENANCE_UNRESOLVED
Removal of the dataset from the tree    OD-2 — TASK-0001's output now exists; the
                                        decision itself is still open
Ledger translation                      OD-5 — AGENTS.md rule 8 governs until amended
Public recruitment                      OD-1
Website shell or toolchain adoption     OD-8 — after math-core extraction
Java engine migration                   OD-13 — approved target; the Word Structures
                                        organization now exists, but migration still
                                        requires its own bounded, separately approved
                                        task
Editing AGENTS.md                       TASK-GOV is a candidate, not approved
Any pedagogy pilot                      transfer task not yet designed
The 85-cell Master puzzle               conditional on g85 verification
Restoring mechanics from Abelisk v2 or the foundation document
```

## Stop conditions

TASK-0001 carried its own stop conditions (`docs/tasks/TASK-0001.md` §9); they were
spent when the task completed. **When a successor implementation task is authorized,
it states its own.**

---

## Standing constraints

```text
MATH_CLAIMS.md is the sole claim authority
no browser or AI output self-certifies
a finite record never supports an infinite-existence claim
REP (reproducibility) and IND (independence) are reported separately
Abelisk v3 active · v2 superseded · foundation historical/reference
English canonical for new public structured content
motor accessibility is an active requirement
pedagogical effectiveness is an untested hypothesis
Java COW Backtracker v1.2 is the reference version, never v1.1
CEGIS Route A remains the research authority unless NEXT_STEP.md changes
```

## Open owner decisions

| # | Subject |
|---|---|
| OD-1 | Git-history remediation — needs a controlled plan |
| OD-2 | D40 dataset rights and provenance — direction recorded, decision open |
| OD-5 | Ledger translation — option D drafted, needs an `AGENTS.md` rule 8 amendment |

Ten others are decided. See `docs/program/OWNER_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md`.
